<article class="floatpicright"><p><img src="images/chick.jpeg" width="4032" height="3024" alt=""/>Crocheting is a huge passion of mine. Some things I like to make inclue stuffed animals, like this little chick. (pictured to the right)</p></article>
<article class="floatpicleft"><p><img src="images/bear ears.jpeg" width="4032" height="3024" alt=""/>A master of the art is definitely not how I would describe myself, although I do have many years of experience. It takes a lot of dedication to be a true master of this lost art. I'm just barely starting to dabble in writing my own patterns. My first true pattern is these "bear ears" (pictured to the left) </p></article>

	<p>Not only do I have a passion for crocheting but I also have a passion for bears. It wasn't until recently (this year), that I realised I have never made a bear related item for myself, so I made this cute little bear stuffie and he's so precious.</p></article>
